# <div align="center"> PROGETTO MOBILE COMPUTING: BROKEN DREAMS </div>
The following project is a small mobile game taken as a delivery for the Mobile Computing exam. It is the result of work carried out by myself and my colleague [Antonio Lanza](https://github.com/AntonioSouls) who worked with me in the entire realization of this project

## Game Plot
The game catapults you into a shattered dream, a dream world where your mind is a prisoner. You are overwhelmed by emotions: *Anger*, *Fear*, *Sadness* and *Depression* have annihilated all rationality, leaving you helpless, at the mercy of their attacks.

**BUT A SPARK STILL BURNS WITHIN YOU**: you want to return to your life. You want to come out of this nightmare.

To do so, you will have to face a challenge: explore the labyrinth of your mind, find where every emotion is hiding and confront the intrusive thoughts that try to stop you.

Only by retrieving the **magic key** can you access the core of emotion. Only by finding the **potion of courage** will you have the strength to face it and overcome it.

*Anger*. *Fear*. *Sadness*. *Depression*. One by one, you will face them. Only by overcoming them all will you be able to wake up and take charge of your life again.
